# Adaptive Segmentation- Mask Attack

This repository contains the implementation of _Adaptive Segmentation Mask Attack (ASMA)_, a targeted adversarial example generation method for deep learning segmentation models. This attack was proposed in  "_Impact of Adversarial Examples on Deep Learning Models for Biomedical Segmentation. U. Ozbulak et al._" and published in the 22nd International Conference on Medical Image Computing and Computer Assisted Intervention, MICCAI-2019.

## General Information
This repository is organized as follows:
* **src/** contains following python files:

  __adaptive_attack.py__ - This file contains the implementation of the main algorithm. Although we have tested the attack in binary segmentation problems, it is designed to work for multi-class problems as well.
